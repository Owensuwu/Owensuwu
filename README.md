🌍 About Me

I'm a geology student passionate about understanding Earth's processes and exploring how technology can enhance geoscience.
Alongside my studies, I enjoy programming, Linux customization, multimedia editing, and building tools that make scientific workflows more efficient and accessible.

Beyond geology and coding, I also work with image editing, YouTube thumbnails, video and audio production, and I contribute to the Deepin Linux ecosystem by creating and improving web pages for deepin.org.
